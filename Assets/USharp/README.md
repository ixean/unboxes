# UdonSharp
## An experimental compiler for compiling C# to Udon assembly

UdonSharp is a compiler that compiles C# to Udon assembly. UdonSharp is not currently conformant to any version of the C# language specification, so there are many things that are not implemented or will not work. If you want to learn C#, I don't recommend you use UdonSharp for learning as it is right now, since there may be language features tutorials assume exist that don't yet exist in U#. 

This compiler is in an early state and I have no prior experience making compilers. There has been very little work done on optimizations. Despite that, programs compiled by this generally perform similarly to their graph-compiled counterparts. Though due to how Udon currently handles copying structs, UdonSharp scripts can generate more garbage than the graph counterparts at the moment. 

## Features that Udon supports which are currently not supported by U#
- UdonSharp is currently at feature parity with the Udon graph as far as I am aware. Please message me or make an issue if you find something that should be supported, but is not.

## C# features supported
- Automatic property and field accessor handling for getting and setting
- Flow control
  - Supports: `if` `else` `while` `for` `do` `foreach` `switch` `return` `break` `continue` `ternary operator (condition ? true : false)` `??`
  - `goto` is not currently supported: https://xkcd.com/292/ I may add it in the future anyways
- Extern method overload resolution with support for default arguments and `params` argument lists
- Implicit and explicit type conversions
- Arrays and array indexers
- All builtin arithmetic operators that Udon exposes (BitwiseNot is not implemented on Udon's side yet and I don't feel like making a special condition for it)
- Conditional short circuiting `(true || CheckIfTrue())` will not execute CheckIfTrue()
- `typeof()`
- Extern methods with out or ref parameters (such as many variants of `Physics.Raycast()`)
- User defined methods with parameters and return values. (This does not currently support method overloads, default parameter values, or `ref`/`params` parameters)
- Unity/Udon event callbacks with arguments. For instance, registering a OnPlayerJoined event with a VRCPlayerApi argument is valid.
- String interpolation
- Field initilizers
- Jagged arrays
- Referencing other custom classes, accessing fields, and calling methods on them

## Differences from regular Unity C# to note
- For the best experience making UdonSharp scripts, make your scripts inherit from `UdonSharpBehaviour` instead of `MonoBehaviour`
- `Instantiate()` uses a method named `VRCInstantiate()` currently since VRC handles instantiate differently.
- If you need to call `GetComponent<UdonBehaviour>()` you will need to use `(UdonBehaviour)GetComponent(typeof(UdonBehaviour))` at the moment since the generic get component is not exposed for UdonBehaviour yet. GetComponent<T>() works for other Unity component types though.
- Udon currently only supports array `[]` collections and by extension UdonSharp only supports arrays at the moment. It looks like they might support `List<T>` at some point, but it is not there yet. 
- User defined methods currently cannot be recursive. They will technically compile, but will likely break because all invocations of a function currently share the same "stack" variables. Support for this is planned as an optional attribute since implementing recursion with Udon's primitives makes it very performance heavy.
- Field initilizers are evaluated at compile time, if you have any init logic that depends on other objects in the scene you should use Start for this.
- Use the `UdonSynced` attribute on fields that you want to sync.  
- Numeric casts are checked for overflow due to UdonVM limitations

## Udon bugs that affect U#
- Heap variables do not get initialized immediately which can cause unexpected behavior. Mainly when you use VRCInstantiate to create an object, the UdonBehaviour components on the instantiated object will not be setup until the next frame. So you cannot set values on the UdonBehaviour script immediately after initialization and attempts to get variables will return null. Due to how `GetComponent<T>` on user defined types works, it will also fail and return null until the behaviour has a chance to initialize its heap. This also happens if you have a UdonBehaviour that has never been enabled. https://vrchat.canny.io/vrchat-udon-closed-alpha-bugs/p/heap-values-are-not-initialized-in-some-cases-so-getprogramvariable-returns-null
- In a similar manner custom events will not be fired immediately after instantiation. And they will not fire on UdonBehaviours that have never been enabled. https://vrchat.canny.io/vrchat-udon-closed-alpha-bugs/p/sendcustomevent-fails-on-gameobjects-that-where-instantiated-in-the-same-functio
- Mutating methods on structs do not modify the struct https://vrchat.canny.io/vrchat-udon-closed-alpha-bugs/p/raysetorigin-and-raysetdirection-not-working
- Instantiated objects will sometimes lose their UdonBehaviour or cannot be interacted with/triggered https://vrchat.canny.io/vrchat-udon-closed-alpha-bugs/p/interactive-objects-break-after-being-clonedinstanciated-on-live-worlds
- Calling Destroy() on an object in game and then using a null check to check if it's valid will throw exceptions in game https://vrchat.canny.io/vrchat-udon-closed-alpha-bugs/p/null-check-on-gameobject-will-throw-exception-if-the-gameobj-is-destroyed

## Setup

### Requirements
- Unity 2018.4.20f1 or greater
- [VRCSDK3 + UdonSDK](https://vrchat.com/home/download)
- The latest [release](https://github.com/Merlin-san/UdonSharp/releases/latest) of UdonSharp

### Installation
1. Read the getting started with Udon official thread https://ask.vrchat.com/t/getting-started-with-udon/80 this has basic installation instructions for Udon.
2. Install the latest version of the VRCSDK3 and UdonSDK linked on the getting started thread. Make sure to install VRCSDK3 first.
3. Get the latest release of UdonSharp from [here](https://github.com/Merlin-san/UdonSharp/releases/latest) and install it to your project.

### Getting started
1. Make a new object in your scene
2. Add an `Udon Behaviour` component to your object
3. Below the "New Program" button click the dropdown and select "Udon C# Program Asset"
4. Now click the New Program button, this will create a new UdonSharp program asset for you
5. Click the Create Script button and choose a save destination and name for the script.
6. This will create a template script that's ready for you to start working on, open the script in your editor of choice and start programming

### Example scripts

#### The rotating cube demo

This rotates the object that it's attached to by 90 degrees every second

```cs
using UnityEngine;
using UdonSharp;

public class RotatingCubeBehaviour : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    private void Update()
    {
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, 90f * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

#### Other examples

For more example scripts take a look at the wiki page for [examples](https://github.com/Merlin-san/UdonSharp/wiki/examples), the Examples folder included with U#, or the [community resources](https://github.com/Merlin-san/UdonSharp/wiki/community-resources) page on the wiki.
